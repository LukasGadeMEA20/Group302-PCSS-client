# Yakboks! client
Welcome to Yakboks! the game! In this game, you need to come up with the funniest, cleverest and most creative answers, to random prompts that you and your friends are given. One of you will become the judge. The judge then have to decide which of them are the best overall, and the chosen winner will be awarded points for their work of art! The judge role will be given to another player after each round, so think of what answer would make that person laugh. Don't worry! The judge does not know who answered what, until they have chosen the best answer.  After everyone has been the judge, the game will end, and the person with the most points will be the winner!
### Introduction
This is the client side for the game, which is what will be used for actually playing the game. The client will provide you with a more visual representation of the game through JavaFX and make it more entertaining to play rather than just typing text input in the console.

The client will ask you for you your username, IP and port when needed. 

There is one bug with the program in which sometimes it will not take the answer a user has submitted - so if the program stops going and the Card Czar doesn't get a new answer just write the new answer again and it should fix it.

The server-side of the game can be found here: https://github.com/LukasGadeMEA20/Group302-PCSS-server

The client side is developed by August V. Clarkfeldt, BjÃ¸rn Troldahl, Christopher Reimers, Daniel S. Rossing, Lukas G. Ravnsborg, Mikkel S. Lauridsen
