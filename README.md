# Yakboks! client
Welcome to Yakboks! the game! In this game, you need to come up with the funniest, cleverest and most creative answers, to random prompts that you and your friends are given. One of you will become the judge. The judge then have to decide which of them are the best overall, and the chosen winner will be awarded points for their work of art! The judge role will be given to another player after each round, so think of what answer would make that person laugh. Don't worry! The judge does not know who answered what, until they have chosen the best answer.  After everyone has been the judge, the game will end, and the person with the most points will be the winner!
